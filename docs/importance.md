## The Command Line

A command-line interpreter (CLI) is a text-based interface to interact with the computer. Rather than clicking through a series of user interfaces, someone using CLI may navigate their computer's file system more efficiently. Assuming the user has achieved a basic understanding of navigation commands, the lower overhead of a purely text-based interface as opposed to a visual one makes the CLI faster. 

Troubleshooting for many low-level applications must be done through CLI. Additionally, a CLI may be used to automate tasks more easily than through a GUI. 


It should be noted that in an effort to draw developers to their platform, both Microsoft and Apple have added CLI analouges to their respective platforms. Windows has the command shell and powershell, while MacOS has the terminal applications. They are designed to mimic the Linux terminal, with many of the commands being similar or identical. MacOS is Unix based, so it is the most similar to Linux. 

The main difference is that Windows and MacOS have both designed their command lines around their GUI. At a surface level, they function similarly to Linux. However, in many cases features are gated behind using their GUI and you are forced to out of the command line anyway. That is not to say they have no use: both Apple and Microsoft have made great efforts in developing the functionality of their CLI.

## Customization

Depending on which distribution you end up using, it may be more or less straightforward to customize your experience. It is difficult to give specific information on the level of customization an average user may do since different distributions have different features. However, since every distribution is open source it is ultimately still possible to change anything with enough know-how.

Out of the box, many Linux distributions offer some kind of customization for icons and desktop themes. Additionally, you may swap around or even design you own custom window managers, desktop environments, and widgets. 

These are some examples from high-level users on r/unixporn:
