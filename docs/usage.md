# Developing in a Linux Environment

---
Looking to try out Linux for yourself, but are attatched to your existing operating system?

Luckily, there are many ways to gain access to at least some of the benefits of using Linux through a variety of developer tools made for people like you. The guides included in this section are designed to inform you of some of the ways you can develop in a Linux environment, and are not meant to be comprehensive. There a handful of methods left out because they are operating system specific (e.g. WSL, sWindows Subsystem for Linux). 

The instructions included expect a certain level of technical ability. Make sure you are comfortable with installing software before you tackle these.
