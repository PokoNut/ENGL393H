## The Unix Operating System

The Unix operating system was originally created in the late 1960s, developed at Bell Labs by a group of AT&T employees. While it was originaly intended for use soley inside Bell Labs, AT&T licensed Unix for outside use in the late 1970s. 

Unix is characterized by a number of features made distinct from other operating systems:

### Portability

### Multitasking

### Heirarchical File System


Despite its age, Unix is still a very modern, portable, and multi-tasking operating system.

## Why was Linux Made?

Since Unix is so effective, why isn't it more popular? The answer can be found in the "Unix wars", a series of disputes over copyright between software companies. Because of its popularity, many software companies sought to monopolize Unix and create their own closed ecosystem to trap users (sound familiar?). In this pursuit, however, many competitors neglected to focus on the actual product. Most Unix clones were feature incomplete and unstable.

Enter Richard Stallman, the creator of the Free Software Foundation and an MIT labs programmer. Throughout his career, he saw for himself the dangers that closed software posed to users. He believed that the user should be free to create, study use, modify, and essentially do whatever they wanted with their software. It should be noted that free software should not necessarily be given away, but it should not be artificially limiting the user. 

To avoid predatory copyright use, Richard came up with the idea of "copyleft". Copyleft is a special kind of copyright, with its only limitation being that any work reegisted under copyleft must not prevent sharing. Additionlly, every modification or addition to sofware under copyleft **must** be licensed under similar rules. Thus, the concept of open source was born.
