## What is an Operating System?

An operating system (OS) is the bridge from a user to computer hardware. If computer hardware is the body of the computer, we can say that an operating system is its soul (i.e. makes the computer operational).

Important functions include:
* Process Management
* I/O Device Management
* File Management
* Network Management
* Memory Management
* Security
* Performance
* User interface
* Many other tasks

## Examples

There are many operating systems in the market, some of which you are likely already familiar with. 

Some of the more popular ones include:
* Microsoft Windows: One of the most popular commercial operating systems, most of which are paid.
* MacOS: Developed and marketed by Apple, it is the primary operating system for all of Apple's Mac computers. 
* iOS: This is an operating system designed by Apple for exclusive use on its mobile devices.
* Android: Another mobile operating system. Interestingly, Android is based on a modified version of Linux. 
* Linux: Based on an older operating system called Unix. It has many different distributions, many of which are free. 

## Closed Source v. Open Source

Every kind of computer sofware is is made using source code. Closed source software, also known as proprietary software, means the source code is not accessible or modifieable by the public. In contrast, open source software is made available for anyone to read, and programmers may change the source code as needed.

Most software today is closed source. This includes many operating systems, most notably Windows and MacOS. Linux, however, is entirely open source. Because it is open source, Linux has many advantages over traditional operating systems.
