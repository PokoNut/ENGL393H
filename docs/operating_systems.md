## What is an Operating System?

An operating system (OS) is the bridge from a user to computer hardware. If computer hardware is the body of the computer, we can say that an operating system is its soul (i.e. makes the computer operational).

Important functions include:
* Process Management
* I/O Device Management
* File Management
* Network Management
* Memory Management
* Security
* Performance
* User interface
* Many other tasks[[1]]

## Examples

There are many operating systems in the market, some of which you are likely already familiar with. 

Some of the more popular ones include:
* Microsoft Windows: One of the most popular commercial operating systems, most of which are paid.
* MacOS: Developed and marketed by Apple, it is the primary operating system for all of Apple's Mac computers. 
* iOS: This is an operating system designed by Apple for exclusive use on its mobile devices.
* Android: Another mobile operating system. Interestingly, Android is based on a modified version of Linux. 
* Linux: Based on an older operating system called Unix. It has many different distributions, many of which are free.

## What Actually is Linux?

What many refer to as the Linux operating system is actually a bit of a misnomer. It's more accurate to say that an operating system is based on the Linux kernel. The kernel of an operating system is said to be the core of an operating system, responsible for controlling how software on a computer may interact with software. Additional utilities, such as compilers or browsers, are bundled on top of the kernel.

An operating system using the Linux kernel is called a Linux "distribution", which are generally responsible for including the additional utilities. Examples include Ubuntu and Debian, both of which run on the Linux kernel. For simplicity, I will continue to refer to any operating system using the Linux kernel as a Linux operating system.

## Closed Source v. Open Source

Every kind of computer software is is made using source code. Closed source software, also known as proprietary software, means the source code is not accessible or modifieable by the public. In contrast, open source software is made available for anyone to read, and programmers may change the source code as needed.

Most software today is closed source. This includes many operating systems, most notably Windows and MacOS. Linux, however, is entirely open source. Because it is open source, Linux has many advantages over traditional operating systems.

### Pricing and Accessibility

Typically, open source software is usually free or discounted heavily. Notably, Linux has many free distributions such as Ubuntu and Debian. While this manual will primarily focus on Ubuntu Linux, there are many other distributions available. Many programmers have their own favorite distribution to use. 

Because Linux is free, it has a much lower barrier to entry than typical proprietary software. 

### Security 

At first intuition, it may seem like closed-source software may be more secure than open source. However, the opposite is usually the case. Since the source code for proprietary software is not visible to the public, there is no guarantee that the developers have actually patched out security vulnerabilities. With open source, there are often a large number of developers working to take part in code reviews and fix bugs.

### Transparency

Nowadays, proprietary software often uses its status as closed-source as an opportunity to take advantage of the user. Because their code is inaccessible, there is no way to determine if software collects and distributes user data to third parties. Since open source software is publically available, it is easy to determine if user data is being abused unnecessarily.
