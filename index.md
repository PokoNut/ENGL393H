## Welcome to a Beginner's Guide to Linux!

![](./assets/logo.png)

Are you a computer science student? Are you interested in computer programming? Or maybe you're just tired of your old operating system? If so, may I offer to you the Linux operating system as an alternative to Windows or MacOS. At a surface level, by using Linux you may:

* Have access to a lightweight and easy-to-run operating system that can run on pretty much anything
* Become a part of a community of developers building powerful tools
* Customize your interface to your personal preferences
* View and modify the original code for the Linux operating system
* Use a variety of tools made for programmers and designed for Linux

The goal of this guide is to impart knowledge of how Linux can accomplish these things as well as to serve as a starting point for further experimentation. To get started, follow the pages on the left.

Check out the source repository for Linux [here].
