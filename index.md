## Welcome to a Beginner's Guide to Linux!

---

### Cover Memo

I am writing the user manual for the Linux operating system primarily for UMD computer science students, but also any student interested in programming. The manual will first describe Linux and its importance to a programmer, and then go into the basics such as installation and common use cases. To accomplish this, I will be creating a website that will present the manual in an intuitive and engaging manner. Ideally, the website will be presented to students as part of an introductory course so that they are already familiar with Linux by the time they reach their advanced courses. I chose this type of document specifically because I am trying to convey how to use Linux. A manual is best suited towards describing best practices and usage of any particular tool, in this case the Linux operating system. 

Since I am a senior computer science student, I already have much experience with Linux. Additionally, I am aware of many struggles introductory students have had with Linux based on my own experiences moving through the computer science major. All of the commands described as well as the ways to use Linux I have already tried and tested. Many of the commands and tips included I have found to be personally valuable in my time using Linux.
